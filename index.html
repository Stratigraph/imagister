    <p>
      The following pages help explore GDELT and ICEWs. The first link will take you to a draft blog post about the two datasets. At the second link you can see an animation of recent events in three countries of interest: Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. Pages at the last two links allow you to "drill down" into data for Egypt with interactive timelines and maps. Similar pages for Syria and Turkey are under development.
