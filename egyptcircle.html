      Use this page to take a closer look at GDELT and Egypt data for 2011-present. You can zoom in to get a better look at the timeline. Important events are labelled, and clicking them will take you to a news story describing the event in greater detail (these are not stories included in either dataset). Highlighting events on a certain date in the timeline shows the corresponding locations of those events (if available) in the map.
